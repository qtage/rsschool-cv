## About me

At the moment, my main job is not related to Web programming. But I have a couple of ideas on how to improve certain mechanisms in team interaction. To implement this, you need to have skills in web development, and preferably in both directions -- frontend and backend. To this end, I became interested in the available information on the search for knowledge in this area and, as one of the sources, decided to try out courses from RS School.

## Skills

At the moment, I am not yet fluent in any of the programming languages, as well as their frameworks.

Plans to master:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Git

## Code examples

```js
function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b;
}
```

## Education

Higher technical education

## About me

At the moment, my main job is not related to Web programming. But I have a couple of ideas on how to improve certain mechanisms in team interaction. To implement this, you need to have skills in web development, and preferably in both directions -- fronted and backend. To this end, I became interested in the available information on the search for knowledge in this area and, as one of the sources, decided to try out courses from RS School.
